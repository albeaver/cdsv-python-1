##Welcome to Coderdojo Silicon Valley
I am your instructor, Alex, and this is where project information will be kept. I reccomend that you stay in the 'Wiki' section. The wiki has code samples, help guides, and notes about the sessions. The Code section has some sample code for some of the challenges that you will be doing.


There will be a link at the start of each session that will redirect to a page on this Github. Most likely, it will link to the 'Wiki' section.
