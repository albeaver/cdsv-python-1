##Welcome to Coderdojo Silicon Valley
I am your instructor, Alex, and this is where project files will be kept. I reccomend that you stay in the 'Wiki' section. The wiki has code samples, help guides, and notes about the sessions. The Code section has some sample code for some of the challenges that you will be doing.
